# Image-Compression
<h3><b>Image compression is the needed for compression of image size. </b><h3> <bR>
Approach: K-means clustering will group similar colors together into ‘k’ clusters of different RGB values.Thus, we need to only store the label for each pixel that tells the cluster to which this pixel belongs. Additionally, we keep a record of the color vectors of each cluster center. <br>
